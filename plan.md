# Plan

## The idea, scoped to minimum viability

A reminder web app where I enter the interval I want ("3 days") and it reminds
me to do that action on the appropriate days. I can click "done" to record that
I completed the action.

### The first use case

Tweet spotlight. Every three days I tweet about a past project.

### Status

Is this functional? No

## Additional features

- A visualization of completed events. Hopefully emphasize momentum (don't want
  to break the chain).
- A tweet inteface directly in the app.
